# The Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project is to investigate the the performance requirements of BEVs in an adequate way. 
# Project Methodology 
This is a data centric project, high frequency drive cycles data were collected. Also acceleration was determined using an accelerometer in addition to just driving it from GPS speed signal.
# Project Main Contributions
* Sorting and parameterized characterization of official drive cycles, put in relation
with own measured cycles
* BEV powertrain component sizing after three differently put performance requirements, with numerous existing BEVs as a frame of reference
* A determination of powertrain component cycle average efficiencies, during various drive cycles using fairly highly detailed and transparent models
* Quantification of the consequence in energy consumption per distance for different
cycles, as well as acceleration performance, while the electric drive system max
output is varied through active length scaling
* Establishing the consequence on electric machine continuous and peak intermittent
torque for four different slot sizes
* Determination of the influence that four different slot sizes has on the total losses
and max temperatures reached during various drive cycles
# Battery electric vehicle (BEV) powertrain
The power of a BEV consists of an electric drive system with battery serving as an energy buffer.
